function [branch1 branch2 dg] = CalcDiversityGain( gain1, gain2, npts )
%CalcRxPowerUniformPhase Compute Received Power given antenna gain in a
%Rayleigh scattering environment.
%   INPUT:
%       gain = complex antenna gain
%       distribution = 2D Rayleight distribution (constant amplitude,
%       uniformly distributed phase) (optional)
%   OUTPUT:
%       branch1 = received power (lin)
%       branch2 = Rayleigh 2D distribution used to compute received power.  Note
%       dg = diversity gain
